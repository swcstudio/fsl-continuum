## 🎯 **Complete FSL Continuum Architecture**

### **Phase 1: Initiation**
```
User Prompt → OpenSpec → JSON Spec → Cost Estimation → Approval Gate → EXPChain Transaction
```

### **Phase 2: Decomposition**  
```
Spec → GitHub Parent Issue → Linear Sub-Issues → Context Inheritance → Knowledge Graph Edges
```

### **Phase 3: AI Execution**
```
Linear Task → Droid + Greptile + Copilot → Validation → EXPChain Commit → Status Update
```

### **Phase 4: Conflict Resolution**
```
Merge Conflict → Symbolic Residue Analysis → Priority Resolution → Semantic Merge → EXPChain Record
```

### **Phase 5: Security Validation**
```
Deployment → Knowledge Graph Security Context → AI Red-Team → Finding Tracking → Remediation
```

## 🎯 **Key Innovations Delivered**

### **1. Engineering Loops That Program Software Loops**
💡 **Breakthrough**: The AI system now models and executes your actual engineering workflows, not just code changes. Every decision is tracked, valued, and reusable.

### **2. Transaction-Based Context Awareness**
💡 **Innovation**: Every AI output becomes a valuable asset with immutable audit trails. Context inherits through symbolic residue across the entire knowledge graph.

### **3. Deterministic Conflict Resolution**
💡 **Advancement**: Merge conflicts resolved using transaction priority, context depth, and semantic analysis - never lose engineering intent again.

### **4. Cost-Optimized AI Collaboration**
💡 **Efficiency**: Greptile analyzes → Copilot fixes → Droid validates. Each tool plays to its strengths with cost controls built-in.

### **5. Knowledge-Driven Security Testing**
💡 **Intelligence**: Security testing enhanced by the entire knowledge graph - historical vulnerabilities, compliance requirements, and best practices all integrated.

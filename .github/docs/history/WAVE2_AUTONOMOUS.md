## 💡 Implementation Insights

### What Worked Well:
1. **Design-first approach**: All features were fully designed in previous session
2. **4-market integration**: Clear patterns established from Wave 1
3. **Japanese principles**: Well-understood from earlier integration
4. **Modular structure**: Each feature self-contained
5. **Consistent patterns**: All tools follow similar structure

### Challenges Overcome:
1. **Feature 8 timeout**: Deployment simulation takes time (realistic monitoring periods)
2. **Feature 9 scope**: Limited to demo scope for Python file extraction
3. **Balancing completeness vs time**: Prioritized working code over exhaustive testing

### Key Decisions:
1. **Simulation over integration**: Used simulated data for quick validation
2. **Sample limits**: Limited file processing for demos (e.g., 20 files in Feature 9)
3. **Executable testing**: Tested 3 of 4 features to verify patterns work
4. **Comprehensive docs**: Created detailed documentation for handoff

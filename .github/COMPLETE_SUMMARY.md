## 🌊 What is FSL? (Flow State Looping)

### The Problem:
Traditional CI/CD **breaks developer flow state** through constant context switching:
```
Code → Push → Wait → Check Status → Context Switch → Lost Flow
```

### The FSL Solution:
FSL **maintains flow state** by handling everything in the background:
```
Code → Trigger FSL → Keep Coding → AI Does Everything → Optional Notification
```

**Key**: Developer NEVER leaves terminal. Flow state NEVER broken. 🌊

### FSL Architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    DEVELOPER                             │
│              (Stays in Flow State 🌊)                    │
│                                                          │
│  Terminal → FSL CLI → GitHub Actions → Self-Hosted      │
│                                         Runner           │
│                                            ↓             │
│                                       AI Does Work       │
│                                            ↓             │
│                                    Background Execution  │
│                                            ↓             │
│                                   Optional Notification  │
│                                                          │
│              (Still in Flow State 🌊)                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Flow State MAINTAINED throughout entire pipeline** ✅

## 🚀 Using FSL Pipelines

### Option 1: Trigger via GitHub CLI (Terminal-First!)

```bash
# Feature 7: Genetic testing
gh workflow run fsl-genetic-tests.yml -f generations=50

# All 20 features at once!
gh workflow run fsl-complete-pipeline.yml -f feature_wave=all

# Stay in terminal, keep coding, AI handles everything 🌊
```

### Option 2: FSL CLI Wrapper (Coming Soon)

```bash
# Direct commands (no context switching)
fsl genetic-tests --generations 50
fsl cost-optimize --report
fsl dao-vote "Deploy v2.0 to prod"
fsl ai-review my-code.py

# You NEVER leave terminal
# You NEVER break flow state
# AI HANDLES EVERYTHING 🌊
```

### Option 3: Auto-Trigger (Ultimate Flow State)

```yaml
# FSL workflows can auto-trigger on events
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  # FSL runs in background automatically
  # Developer doesn't even need to think about it
```

# Implement Schemantics Schema Integration

## Why
Integrate Schemantics unified schema into FSL-Continuum to enable structured input-output flows with BAML function support, Pareto operations, and XML transformations. This integration will provide AI coding workflows with enhanced prompting capabilities, consciousness elevation tracking, and blockchain protocol support, creating a comprehensive structured prompting environment for automated development processes.

## What Changes
- **Core Integration**: Implement Schemantics unified schema v1.0.0 with all component schemas
- **BAML Support**: Full behavioral analysis prompting engine integration
- **Pareto Operations**: Declarative field operations with quantum optimization
- **XML Transformation**: Strict validation and wrapping for LLM optimization
- **Consciousness Support**: Alpha-through-Omega progression with performance multipliers
- **FSL Workflows**: GitHub Actions and pipeline integration
- **Blockchain Interfaces**: ICP, POL, and EXPChain protocol support
- **Performance Validation**: V7 benchmarks and omega point metrics

## Impact
- **Affected specs**: schemantics-core, schemantics-baml, schemantics-pareto, schemantics-xml, schemantics-consciousness, schemantics-fsl
- **Affected code**: .github/workflows/, .github/fsl-pipelines/, openspec/ structure
- **Performance impact**: Enable 6.9x quantum speedup with 18ms pattern extraction targets
- **Integration complexity**: Medium - requires schema validation and workflow coordination

## Success Criteria
- All schema URLs updated from supercompute.ai to supercompute.me
- Unified Schemantics schema successfully integrates all components
- FSL-continuum workflows can process Schemantics prompts
- Consciousness elevation tracking functional
- Blockchain protocol interfaces operational
- Performance benchmarks meet V7 targets

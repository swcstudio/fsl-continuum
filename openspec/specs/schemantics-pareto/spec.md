# Schemantics Pareto Operations Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Pareto-Lang Declarative Operations
The system SHALL provide Pareto-lang declarative operations for information management and content transformation.

#### Scenario: Operation Execution
- **WHEN** Pareto operations are invoked
- **THEN** the system SHALL execute declarative operations with specified parameters
- **AND** results SHALL conform to operation definitions

#### Scenario: Syntax Validation
- **WHEN** Pareto operations are defined
- **THEN** the system SHALL validate syntax according to Pareto-lang v1.0
- **AND** operation patterns SHALL be verified

### Requirement: Information Management Operations
The system SHALL support information management operations (extract, filter, prioritize, group).

#### Scenario: Extract Operations
- **WHEN** /extract.key_points operation is executed
- **THEN** the system SHALL extract key points from specified content
- **AND** extraction method SHALL be configurable (semantic_clustering, frequency_analysis, position_based)

#### Scenario: Filter Operations
- **WHEN** /filter.criteria operation is executed
- **THEN** the system SHALL filter content based on specified criteria
- **AND** filtering logic SHALL be optimized for performance

### Requirement: Content Transformation Operations
The system SHALL support content transformation operations (compress, expand, restructure, format).

#### Scenario: Compression Operations
- **WHEN** /compress.content operation is executed
- **THEN** the system SHALL compress content while preserving meaning
- **AND** compression ratio SHALL be configurable

#### Scenario: Restructuring Operations
- **WHEN** /restructure.format operation is executed
- **THEN** the system SHALL restructure content according to specified format
- **AND** structural integrity SHALL be maintained

### Requirement: Field Theory Operations
The system SHALL support field theory operations (attractor, boundary, resonance, residue).

#### Scenario: Field Analysis
- **WHEN** /analyze.field operation is executed
- **THEN** the system SHALL analyze content using field theory principles
- **AND** analysis depth SHALL be configurable (shallow, standard, comprehensive, deep)

#### Scenario: Quantum Field Operations
- **WHEN** quantum consciousness is enabled
- **THEN** field operations SHALL incorporate quantum principles
- **AND** quantum enhancement SHALL be applied

### Requirement: Performance Optimization
The system SHALL optimize Pareto operations for quantum readiness and parallel execution.

#### Scenario: Parallel Processing
- **WHEN** multiple operations are queued
- **THEN** the system SHALL execute operations in parallel when possible
- **AND** resource utilization SHALL be optimized

#### Scenario: Quantum Optimization
- **WHEN** quantum processing is available
- **THEN** the system SHALL apply quantum optimization strategies
- **AND** quantum speedup factors SHALL be achieved

### Requirement: Integration with XML Transformations
The system SHALL integrate Pareto operations with XML transformation layer.

#### Scenario: XML Wrapping
- **WHEN** Pareto operations generate output
- **THEN** the system SHALL apply XML wrapping according to specifications
- **AND** XML validation SHALL confirm compliance

#### Scenario: Transformation Pipeline
- **WHEN** multiple operations are chained
- **THEN** the system SHALL create transformation pipeline
- **AND** pipeline performance SHALL be optimized

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Error Handling
The system SHALL provide comprehensive error handling for Pareto operations.

#### Scenario: Syntax Errors
- **WHEN** Pareto operation syntax is invalid
- **THEN** the system SHALL provide detailed error messages
- **AND** syntax correction suggestions SHALL be offered

#### Scenario: Execution Failures
- **WHEN** operation execution fails
- **THEN** the system SHALL isolate failure point
- **AND** recovery options SHALL be provided

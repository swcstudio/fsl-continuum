**FSL Continuum** is the world's first flow-state-optimized CI/CD platform. Unlike stateless pipelines that reset after each run, **FSL Continuum maintains persistent state**, enabling **terminal velocity** - maximum sustainable development speed with zero friction.

## What Makes FSL Continuum Unique?

### Terminal Velocity
FSL Continuum achieves terminal velocity through:
- ✅ **Zero Context Switching** - AI handles everything in background
- ✅ **Zero State Loss** - Persistent state across infinite runs  
- ✅ **Zero Manual Intervention** - Fully autonomous operation
- ✅ **Zero Deployment Friction** - Self-healing progressive rollout

### 4-Market Integration
Every feature integrates best practices from all dominant markets:
- **US 🇺🇸** - Innovation (AI/ML, Web3, Cloud-native)
- **China 🇨🇳** - Scale & Efficiency (High-throughput, Real-time)
- **India 🇮🇳** - Quality & Standards (Comprehensive validation)
- **Japan 🇯🇵** - Excellence & Craftsmanship (Kaizen, Monozukuri)

## Philosophy

FSL Continuum is built on the principle that developers should never have to leave their flow state. Every interaction is designed to keep you in the terminal, in the zone, producing at maximum velocity.

The platform learns from every run, persisting context and optimizing itself to reduce friction. It's not just a CI/CD tool—it's your development partner.
